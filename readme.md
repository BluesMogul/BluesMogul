**After a successful career as a marketing executive :trophy: I have decided to pivot to a new career as a web developer.** :nerd_face:

Over the last two decades, I have developed technical skills not typically held by my marketing peers. I have a wealth of experience in database development, (certified) network administration, CRM development and administration, graphic design, and web development.

As an executive team member and “technology evangelist,” my technical background enabled me to act as a liaison between senior leadership and internal and external technology resources. In addition to my long list of marketing responsibilities, I championed the use of technology to help meet the organization's goals. From the drop, I found working with tech extremely satisfying and enjoyed work that allowed me to use my analytical *and* creative capabilities.

**So here I am.** :rocket:

I'm excited to be learning and working with smart people on interesting projects--none of which involve dealing with some Porsche-driving EVP who doesn't understand why his $5,000 monthly spend on Google AdWords *isn't doubling his sales numbers.* :neutral_face:
